# Lightning Network ![Lightning Network Flaws](lightning-risk.png "Lightning Network")

**WARNING: If you try to use the Lightning Network (LN) you are at HIGH RISK of losing funds and it is not recommended or safe to do at this time or for the foreseeable future.**

*Below is a chronological list which shows that Lightning Network has been drowning in technical issues, bugs, flaws, critiques, and exploits. It's over-promised tech that doesn't deliver on decentralization and a long ways from being functional and safe for users.*

April 13, 2021: Video discussion with LN engineer about pros and cons of LN. Tidbits include that LN transactions always require onchain transactions to be finalized/settled (problematic due to high fees), initial payment channels still an issue for new users, using LN service providers is a trust issue, not decentralized, using zero-conf to create channels is highly risky, must be online to use LN, constant backups needed so you don't lose funds, LN needs more forks to work (such as Taproot and El-Too) https://odysee.com/@DigitalCashNetwork:c/Lightning-Network:c

October 4, 2021: Three new Lightning Network vulnerabilities were disclosed affecting multiple LN implementations. These vulnerabilities can be exploited in a wide range of attacks, going from fee blackmailing of node operators, burning liquidity of your competing LSPs or even stealing your counterparty channel balance if you avail mining capabilities. Exercise of the vulnerability revealed that a majority of the balance funds can be at loss. CVE-2021-41591/ CVE-2021-41592 / CVE-2021-41593 "Dust HTLC Exposure Considered Harmful." https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/lightning-dev/2021-October/003257.html

November 3, 2021: Lightning Network channel jamming is when a malicious entity blocks up liquidity in the lightning network, by making a payment to themselves, via third party channels and then never revealing the secret, such that the payment never completes. The main idea behind jamming is occupying the capabilities of routing nodes to forward payments by making fake payments and never finalizing them. For the attack duration, it becomes impossible for routing nodes to forward other (honest) payments. To jam certain channels, an attacker pretends to make a payment to themself via those channels, and never releases the secret on the receiver side. https://blog.bitmex.com/preventing-channel-jamming/

* https://archive.ph/yNaBl

February 16, 2022: Lightning Network speed update - as a service, it is hard to choose reliable LN routing peers that forward payments quickly. Plenty of nodes have bad response times and do not maintain proper liquidity in their channels, which makes payments slow. https://blog.lnrouter.app/lightning-payment-speed-2022

February 19, 2022: Sharp-eyed Bitcoin community members discover that Lightning Network developers working for Lightning Labs are part of the World Economic Forum (WEF). The WEF is well known for being a world government sanctioned and banker elite conglomerate that runs the global financial system in a centralized top-down authoritarian way. This discovery helps to shine light on the centralized goals of the Lightning Network.

February 21, 2022: Lightning Network faces many challenges, such as 1) while technically two-party payment channels can exist off-chain forever, in practice they suffer from liquidity depletion bounding their lifetime, 2) two-party payment channels occupy significant block space per user when they get opened/closed, setting a bound on the number of LN users concurrently, and 3) multi-hop trust-minimized routing may cause even more channel closings (in-flight HTLCs leading to onchain claims).

### 2023 and Beyond

Unfortunately, the Lightning Network has been a disappointment since its inception in 2015. It has been an utter failure and has not delivered, and instead has led to centralization and reliance on custodial services and third-party companies. We have decided to stop following the development of the Lightning Network in this repository, as we believe it is a waste of time and resources. We recommend using a more reliable, secure, functional, and decentralized cryptocurrency, such as [Bitcoin Cash (BCH)](https://bitcoinprotocol.org/), which has been working just fine since the Genesis Block in 2009.
